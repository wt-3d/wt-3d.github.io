# Installation for ratgdo v2.x Case
All versions of the enclosures are designed to be able to secure the PCB with the screws provided. For version 2.5 you will need to remove the ESP from the board. It should be removed vertically.

## Installation Options
* Install Magnetically. Useful when attaching to the body of the opener or to the top metal plate. 
* Screw mount with back strap to be able to mount using preexisting punched/slotted angle on the opener itself or vertical supports. Example Below.
* Zip tie using the ears on the side.
