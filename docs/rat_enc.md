# Installation for ratgdo v2.x Case
Thank you for your purchase of the ratgdo 2.x case/enclosure!

All versions of the enclosures are designed to be able to secure the PCB with the screws provided. The PCB is to be placed in first, then the washer/spacer. 

For version 2.0, install with the ESP attached to the board.

For version 2.5 (Non integrated ESP) you will need to remove the ESP from the board. It should be removed vertically.

## Installation Options
* Install Magnetically. 
    * Useful when attaching to the body of the opener or to the top metal plate. 
* Screw mounted using the back strap provided. 
    * This is to be able to mount using preexisting punched/slotted angle on the opener itself or vertical supports. Example Below.
* Zip tie using the ears on the side.

## Strain Relief for v2.52i
The strain relief for 2.52i is optional but recommended as the connectors are fragile. 

There are recesses built into the lid in the event that the zip tie head sits proud of the case top. Flush cutting the zip tie tail is recomended. 

Included in your kit is additional zip ties to be used for the strain relief.
